# Cosmic Background

A simple dashboard encouraging a diffuse set of validators on Tendermint networks.

Constructed for the Agoric Testnet. Easily portable to any Tendermint network.

If you're interested in using this dashboard on a different Tendermint network, please [reach out](https://twitter.com/0xd18b) and we can parameterize it.

#### Example: Measuring the network health of the cosmoshub-4 network

#### TODO
- refactor into component per tab
- make block# variable
- add "dashboard mode" which polls and rotates
